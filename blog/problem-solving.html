            <h2>Explain a time you were stuck on a simple problem</h2>
            <p>
                It can be relatively easy to get stuck on a simple problem - a problem that you initially don’t think
                much of has an easy time getting a stranglehold on you when underestimated!
                And it is always, without fail, the easy problems that make you feel most like your head is filled with
                nothing but rocks, - but that’s okay, after all, the essence of humanity <strong>is</strong> folly.
            </p>
            <p>
                A simple problem that I've gotten stuck on a few times more than I’d like to truly admit is naming and
                links. Oh, it seems so blatantly easy a fix, but when you have a document of one hundred lines or more
                and your IDE thinks all is fine, and you think all is fine - it becomes a nightmare.
            </p>
            <p>
                Of course, you try the logical debugging process first - you console.log() to see your output, you run
                your debugger, all else seems fine, why isn’t it working? Has the world decided that this day of all
                days was the primest of days to rain down hellfire on your pride and your script?
            </p>
            <p>
                Absolutely it did, and then, you see it - <span class="code">line 37 column 5</span>, and you realise
                you rained down hellfire on
                yourself.
                It’s a tad bit of a sore feeling, realising that your issue stems from the most minimal of human errors,
                but it’s an alleviating one as well, it’s one that’s easy to brush off with a laugh and ‘oh of COURSE
                this is why it happened’.
            </p>
            <p>
                The easy stuff has to be taken with a sense of humour and a bit more grace than we usually give it. It
                may be embarrassing at the moment, sure, but easy mistakes are common, I mean, we’ve all had legs for
                20+ years and still trip up on them occasionally.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div>
            <h2>Explain a time when you elegantly solved a problem</h2>
            <p>
                There are a few times when I like to think I was able to elegantly solve a problem! Just recently, in
                fact, when completing the super fizzbuzz challenge during sprint 4.
            </p>
            <p>
                I thought about the problem logically, understood what I wanted, and figured out how to get there, and
                like a fizzbuzz ballerina I wrote out my map - and it was done. To be entirely frank, I did not expect
                it to pass all the tests on the first go, but I can surely say I was pleasantly surprised that it did.
            </p>
            <p>
                In the end, I guess the one thing we all must do as much as we possibly can, is to reserve our
                expectations or internal restrictions, and not apply them to the problem.
                I could have made the task harder on myself by convincing myself that I couldn’t, or shouldn’t use x or
                y to solve the problem, figuratively attaching myself to an anchor.
                But all it does is increase the challenge, and while upping the difficulty factor for yourself can be
                great when practising deliberate practice, in real-world and general problem-solving the simplest
                solution is often the best one. Both for yourself, and others (including future YOU!).
            </p>
        </div>

        <div>
            <h2>Explain a time when you were reluctant to ask for help</h2>
            <p>I think we all experience times when we are reluctant to ask for help. We figuratively chain ourselves
                up in restrictions because of pride, shame, or other feelings that often make more of a fool out of
                ourselves than if we just asked for help. Frankly, we’ve all been on either side of every side, -
                getting help, refusing help due to clownish pride, offering help or getting ourselves frustrated.
            </p>
            <p>
                It’s especially hard to ask for help when we think our problem is silly, minimal, stupid, or ‘I should
                be able to do this by now, dammit!’ But that’s surprisingly never the actual case, and when we get
                frustrated we quickly become close-minded about our problems. Sometimes, you have to fall pretty deep
                into this pit of despair to see no way out to ask, and realise that it’s fine - and people are happy to
                help, and no, these problems aren’t stupid by any means.
            </p>
            <p>
                I like to think that I’ve fallen down that pit enough times to realise that there is a certain point
                when you are stuck on a problem where you simply have to ask for help. The cost of the time you waste
                and the hairs you lose over a problem simply isn’t worth it, and people are almost always happy to help,
                should you seek it.
            </p>

            <h2>How confident are you in the following techniques?</h2>
            <h3>Pseudocode</h3>
            <p>
                Pseudocode is a very comfy lounge chair in my mental model, and I love it. I think it’s absolutely
                fantastic for figuring out logic flow, or simply even working out what the next steps are. Like a good
                almond brittle, you can just keep breaking it up more and more as you need.
            </p>
            <h3>Trying Something</h3>
            <p>
                Simply trying something can be a touch of a double-edged sword, in my experience. You may end up trying
                too many things, simply hammering away at a problem and become increasingly frantic when it isn’t
                working, or you may take it slow and easy, and just repeatedly try something new. Personally, it can be
                a bit of a wildcard.
            </p>
            <h3>Reading Error Messages</h3>
            <p>
                The bread to my butter for debugging. Error messages are beautiful, and I think it is all too often that
                people see red and get scared or stressed, when in reality it’s a shining red light of salvation -
                you’ve just got to read the error message.
            </p>
            <h3>Console.logging</h3>
            <p>
                The butter to my bread! If you don’t know what the value or type of a value is, how can you ever hope to
                solve it outside sheer luck? Alright, there’s certainly a way, but console.logging gets you on the
                highway to the solution.
            </p>
            <h3>Googling</h3>
            <p>
                If error messages are your bread, and console.logging is your butter, Google is your beginner’s guide to
                bread guidebook. Horrible analogy, I know, but hear me out. When you don’t know exactly what your bread,
                or error message is saying, you can look it up in Google and get at the very least a basic idea of what
                went wrong and why it may have happened. That gets you your bread crumbs leading towards the solution - 
                you’ve just got to follow them.
            </p>
            <h3>Rubber Duckying</h3>
            <p>
                The beautiful and timeless classic! The beauty of the rubber ducky technique is that you can
                figuratively morph anything into your trusty rubber duck, you’ve just got to talk to it. I love using
                this method, and it ties in very nicely to pseudocode as well, as sometimes when you explain the problem
                to your rubber duck, you figure out the solution and bam! - your words turn into pseudocode.
            </p>
            <h3>Asking Peers</h3>
            <p>
                I’m pretty confident at asking my peers for help, though I’m always a bit worried about putting
                expectations on them, especially since we are all learning something new, and it’s hard. But I realise
                that by giving them a chance to help me, we’re both given a chance to learn and improve our skills.
                It’s something I need to practise a bit more, and give others more opportunities to help.
            </p>
            <h3>Asking Coaches</h3>
            <p>
                It’s always great when you can ask someone more experienced than yourself for aid, because you know
                you’ll learn quite a lot from it, and in a collaborative environment, that’s what they’re here for. It
                can be a little intimidating at first when you don’t know your coaches well, but after a couple of
                questions and a couple of chats it becomes pretty natural.
            </p>
            <h3>Improving Through Reflection</h3>
            <p>
                Reflection has been helping me a lot, and in general is something that’s really shaped me as a person. I
                liken reflection to kneading dough or carving a sculpture. Each time you reflect and truly internalise
                that reflection, you refine yourself a little bit more. It’s a slow and painful process, but even
                Michelangelo’s sculptures started as blocks of marble.
