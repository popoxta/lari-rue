                Deep within the uncharted depths, an ancient dweller awaits; Javascript. Born from mysterious
                machinations
                in 1995, its presence has grown to monumental proportions. Traveler, heed this warning, for this
                formidable
                dweller is a force to be reckoned, a master of extraordinary marvels and treacherous pitfalls.
                It's power knows no bounds - not even the web itself.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h2>How does JavaScript relate to HTML & CSS?</h2>

            <p>
                The relationship between JavaScript, CSS and HTML is something which may be compared to a video game! In
                this analogy, HTML serves as the backbone, representing 3D models and graphics within the world, however
                it lacks visual polish and nice textures.
            </p>
            <p>
                CSS is the artist, providing the textures and bringing life to models, scenery and effects. It adds the
                detailed visual elements, transforming the bland 3d models and breathing visual life into the
                environment
            </p>
            <p>
                However it is JavaScript which truly makes the experience - it acts as the core functionality and
                gameplay itself, shaping how non-playable characters (NPCs) interact with the player, the mechanics of
                the gameplay and enabling other actions which the player can make, making the game, well, a game.
            </p>
            <p>
                Together they work well in creating a fully fledged experience, where HTML creates the foundation, CSS
                provides the visuals and JavaScript adds the functionality.
            </p>

            <h2>What is the DOM?</h2>
            <p>
                The DOM, or the Document Object Model, is a tree-like structure that represents the content of an HTML
                document - a web page. When a page is loaded within the browser, this structure is created and stored
                within memory.
            </p>
            <p>
                The DOM may be thought of similarly to a family tree, where the document object acts as the root, or
                founding ancestor of said tree. Each branch of the tree represents a different part of the webpage, such
                as landmarks, headings, images or buttons. These are all considered Nodes, and they may have their own
                branches and nodes as well.
            </p>
            <p>
                The DOM is dynamic, meaning that it may be changed with the use of JavaScript! When JavaScript is used
                to modify the DOM, any changes it makes are reflected on the screen. For example, it can be used to add
                new elements (nodes), remove existing ones, or change their content.
                It is however important to keep in mind that any changes made to the DOM with JavaScript do not affect
                the original document/file itself!
            </p>

            <h2>What are Functions?</h2>
            <p>
                Functions are like recipes for code! They allow for the creation of reusable instructions to perform a
                specific task, like baking bread.
            </p>
            <p>
                Now let’s say you’re a baker, and you’ve decided to add a sunflower-seed loaf to your shop. However,
                every time you make this loaf, it turns out slightly different, and your customers <em>notice</em>.
            </p>
            <p>
                To solve this, you decide to write a recipe, aka a function.
                By writing down a recipe, you ensure that every time you make your sunflower-seed loaf, you follow the
                same procedures, ensuring that each loaf turns out the same way.
            </p>
            <p>
                The great thing about this recipe is that if you ever want to make changes to your loaf, you only need
                to update the recipe, and you don’t need to modify the process for every single loaf. Once the recipe is
                updated, every time you bake your sunflower-seed loaf, the changes are automatically implemented.
            </p>

            <h2>Explain Control Flow and Loops</h2>
            <p>
                Control flow and loops are the bread and butter of programming, almost literally. In fact, I will even
                make analogies for each of these based on the prior sentence alone.
            </p>
            <h3>
                Control Flow
            </h3>
            <p>
                Control flow is quite comparable to when you open your pantry, and you make a decision based on specific
                conditions. In our example, you’re looking for bread, so you check to see if you have bread in the
                pantry. If there is bread, you take it out, so you may eat it. If there isn’t bread, well, you may have
                to go to the grocery store.
                This conditional ‘logic’ is control flow.
            </p>
            <h3>
                Loops
            </h3>
            <p>
                Now, let’s imagine that you did have bread, so you grab some butter as well and sit down to eat your
                bread. Since you’ve got a funky eating habit, you decide to cut up the pieces of bread into tiny bites.
                Then, every time you take a piece, you butter it, eat it, and reach for the next - until they’re all
                gone.
                Here, you’ve introduced a loop - repeating a specific set of actions until a certain condition is met -
                in this case, until you’ve eaten all the bread!
            </p>

            <h2>What is the difference when accessing data from Arrays and Objects?</h2>
            <p>
                Arrays and Objects are both data structures which are used to store information, however the way in
                which information is accessed is slightly different. In essence, they may both be likened to the
                structure of hotel rooms. Consider the following;
            </p>

            <h3>
                Arrays
            </h3>
            <p>
                Think of an array as a row of hotel rooms, where each room is ordered from left to right, starting from
                0. So, the first room is room 0, the second room is room 1, the third is room 2, and so on. To access
                the information stored within a specific room, you simply need to know the room number, which is the
                index.
            </p>
            <p>
                For example, if you wanted to know what was within room 3, you can access that room by using its index -
                e.g. <span class="code">rooms[2]</span>
            </p>
            <h3>
                Objects
            </h3>
            <p>
                Now, imagine you are in a different hotel, and fortunately for you, your second hotel cares a little bit
                more about privacy. In this hotel, you can’t access a room just by knowing the room number, instead, you
                need to know the room’s unique name, like ‘jazzy-spa-room’.
            </p>
            <p>
                Every room has a special name, which acts as the key. Once you know the name (key) of the room, you may
                access the room, aka the values, via either dot notation e.g.
                <span class="code">rooms.jazzy-spa-room</span> or bracket notation
                e.g. <span class="code">rooms[jazzy-spa-room]</span>
            </p>
