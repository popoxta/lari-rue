            <h2>Explain an ethical decision you have made</h2>
            <p>I believe ethical decisions encompass a wide range of choices that we all make every day, from individual
                environmental responsibility to more critical matters such as healthcare confidentiality and
                privacy.
            </p>
            <p>One ethical decision I had faced involved reporting employee misconduct. Maintaining honesty and
                integrity is crucial within any workplace, especially when working with a small team where every
                individual’s contribution matters.</p>
            <p>I discovered that a coworker, whom I had a very good relationship with was performing work for another
                business during office hours and began neglecting their duties. Being a small team, this quickly began
                to negatively affect our performance and productivity.

                I initially attempted to resolve this directly through open communication, and struck up a conversation
                with them directly. I let them know my concerns and wanted to understand their reasoning, though despite
                the conversation ending on a positive note the situation did not improve.
            </p>
            <p>Realising that I could not resolve the problem internally, I decided to report the misconduct to our team
                leader. While I felt some guilt about potentially risking my coworker's employment, I knew it was best
                to prioritise the team as a whole.
                I approached our team leader with transparency and let him know of the situation and my feelings toward
                it.
            </p>
            <p>I won’t delve into the specifics further, however the issue was formally resolved and my team leader
                expressed gratitude for my open communication and handling of the situation.
            </p>

            <h2>How have your culture and the people around you influenced your values and
                identity?</h2>
            <p>
                As a German, be it from culture or otherwise, my family and I are naturally quite pragmatic - it’s even
                the namesake of my father’s business!
            </p>
            <p>
                Pragma is a bit of a funny thing, it embodies the notion of being grounded in reality and focusing on
                what works rather than being swept up by ideals. Of course, it has its drawbacks, sometimes it becomes a
                limiter on creativity, and it’s easy to spend too much time thinking about the correct way of doing
                things - a trap which I am unfortunately prone to.
            </p>
            <p>
                I have met several people who have shown me what I would never want to become, and it has made me value
                integrity, care and respect above all else.
                I wholeheartedly believe that if we put in a little care and effort for the world and the surrounding
                communities, we can make the world a better place to live.
            </p>

        <div>
            <h2>What are your strengths and how will they support you during your learning
                journey?</h2>
            <p>
                I've faced significant hardships, but my determination and resilience have kept me going, and I think
                this will be a significant factor in my learning journey at DevAcademy.
            </p>
            <p>
                Additionally, I’ve always had a bit of a knack for making connections in my understanding, and it’s
                something that I love to share with the people around me. I believe knowledge grows best when it is
                shared, and helping others on their journey brings me a sense of fulfilment.
            </p>
            <p>

                Software is a heavily collaborative industry, and the better I can help my teammates collaborate and
                learn from each other, the more we will learn and the more we can make of this learning journey
                together.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div>
            <h2>What are your limitations in terms of learning and career?</h2>
            <p>
                One challenge I face is self-doubt, particularly when it comes to measuring my own worth and skills. I
                find comfort in concrete values like statistics and facts, which makes self-assessment difficult.
            </p>
            <p>
                Although I have been working on overcoming this over time, it remains a deeply ingrained aspect of my
                personality. Stepping into an entirely new industry will likely be a struggle.
            </p>
            <p>
                Despite this, I am determined to push through and break down these limiting beliefs. I do not quantify
                other’s worth, so neither should I do it to myself.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div>
            <h2>Share an example of when you were trying to work productively with others, but
                there was resistance or tension</h2>
            <p>
                In a mentoring role, I noticed that some staff members were hesitant and fearful about learning a new
                technology which would be integrated into business-as-usual.
            </p>
            <p>
                To address this, I decided that I would need to change my approach by allowing them to lead their own
                learning based on a set of guidelines. I provided a reference sheet with key points and small
                explanations for their sessions.
                I ensured that I listened to their concerns, and incorporated more hands-on activities, creating a more
                supportive and practical learning environment. The staff members became more engaged and confident, and
                their initial resistance truly turned into enthusiasm.
            </p>
            <p>
                I believe this experience was incredibly valuable, and it taught me that it was important to be flexible
                in teaching, and that offering personalised guidance truly empowers others to embrace their challenges.
