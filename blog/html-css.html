    <h1 class="blog-title">Positioning</h1>
    <hr>
    <article class="blog-content">
        <div class="blog-section wide-paragraph">
            <p>
                There are several options available for positioning when modifying an element in CSS - relative, absolute
                and fixed. But what do they really mean?
                Thankfully the answer is fairly simple, and all positions relate to the <b>normal flow</b> of the document.
            </p>

        </div>

        <div class="blog-section">
            <h2 class="blog-subheader">Normal Flow</h2>
            <p>
                The term ‘normal flow’, also known as document flow or default flow, refers to the default behavior of
                how
                HTML elements are placed onto a webpage when no styling properties are applied.
                (This is also <span class="code">position:static</span>!)
            </p>
            <p>
                When elements are in a normal flow state, they are typically displayed one after the other in a top-down
                fashion for block-level elements, or next to each other for inline-level elements.
            </p>
            <p>
                So where does positioning come in?
                When elements are set to <span class="code">position:absolute</span> or <span class="code">position:fixed</span>,
                the element in question is whisked away
                from the normal document flow. This allows for these elements to be positioned in ways or places which
                they
                would otherwise be very tricky to achieve.
            </p>
            <p>
                The most commonly used positions are <b>relative</b>, <b>fixed</b> and <b>absolute</b>. I will go into
                each briefly,
                explaining
                their use cases and how they relate to one another.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="blog-section">
            <h2 class="blog-subheader">Relative</h2>
            <p>
                When an element’s position is set to <span class="code">position:relative</span>, it is still positioned
                as per the normal flow of
                the
                document - however it may then be offset from this position.
                Properties such as left, right, top and bottom may be used to relatively position the element.
            </p>
            <p>
                It is important to note that with the relative position, the space which the element would have occupied
                in
                a static state is still considered occupied by this element - even if it has been positioned to an
                entirely different sector of the document.
            </p>
            <p>
                Relatively positioned elements are commonly used for creating offsets, decorative effects or as a parent
                container to absolutely positioned elements.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="blog-section">
            <h2 class="blog-subheader">Absolute</h2>
            <p>
                An absolute-positioned element is removed entirely from the normal document flow, and in contrast to
                <span class="code">position:relative</span>, no space is kept in the original static position.
            </p>
            <p>
                An element with <span class="code">position:absolute</span> becomes positioned relatively to its closest
                positioned parent element, commonly with a position of relative.
                For example, an absolute positioned element within a relatively positioned container can be positioned
                relatively to its parent container.
            </p>
            <p>
                Absolutely positioned elements are often used to create modals, overlays or tooltips.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="blog-section">
            <h2 class="blog-subheader">Fixed</h2>
            <p>
                The functionality of a <span class="code">position:fixed</span> element creates a major change from the
                other potential position values discussed.
                It ensures that the element in question is fixed to the viewport, so that even if the user scrolls down
                the page, the element will still be within it's designated position.
            </p>
            <p>
                Fixed position elements are used to create persisting sidebars, action buttons, modals or alerts.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="blog-section">
            <h2 class="blog-subheader">Sticky</h2>
            <p>
                <span class="code">position:sticky</span> is a position that holds a hybrid role between fixed and
                relative positioning.
                An element with this position is rendered as per the normal flow, however when the
                user scrolls down the page and the threshold value for the element is met,
                the element becomes sticky and sticks to a specified position on the viewport.
            </p>
            <p>
                Sticky positioned elements are used to create sticky headers or navigation menus.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="blog-section wide-paragraph conclusion">
            <h2 class="blog-subheader">Conclusion</h2>
            <p>
                This is just a basic overview of a few common position values which are available, but bear in mind that
                the best way to truly learn about these positions and understand their benefits and drawbacks is to try them for yourself.
            </p>
            <p>
                Create a modal, a sticky header, a fixed menu - or even propose an entirely new spec.
