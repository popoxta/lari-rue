                Intelligence quotient, or IQ, measures a person’s reasoning ability and measurable intelligence.
                Emotional
                quotient, or EQ, refers to the ability of a person to regulate emotions in a productive manner and
                empathise
                with others.
                In this exploration we will explore both and understand their differences and benefits.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div>
            <h2>What is Emotional Intelligence?</h2>
            <p>
                Emotional intelligence is the ability of an individual to recognize, label and understand their own
                emotions, as well as the emotions of others.
            </p>
            <p>
                The topic of emotional intelligence has long been a subject of criticism and debate, and there are
                criticisms surrounding the topic of emotional intelligence.
                These criticisms focus on the research conducted on emotional intelligence, labeling it as difficult to
                measure and susceptible to manipulation.
            </p>
            <p>
                However it is important to note that the topic has been extensively studied within the field of
                psychology, and there is substantial evidence supporting its significance and validity. While criticisms
                exist and are worth consideration, it would be inaccurate to dismiss emotional intelligence as a trend
                or marketing scheme.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div>
            <h2>The Emotional Intelligence Model</h2>
            <p>
                It is argued that in order for an individual to be considered emotionally intelligent, they must
                possess certain competencies.
                There are several different models of emotional intelligence, namely the ability, mixed and trait
                models.

            </p>
            <p>
                However, for this exploration I will be focusing on the ability model, originally introduced by
                Peter Salovey and John Mayer.
                The emotional intelligence ability model proposes that each individual varies in their ability to
                process emotions, and that this ability can manifest itself in several different attributes.
            </p>
            <h3>Perception</h3>
            <p>
                Perception defines how an individual perceives emotions both internally and externally. This may be
                through various indicators, such as voices, verbal communication, facial expression and body
                language.
            </p>
            <h3>Use of Emotion</h3>
            <p>
                The ability for an individual to use emotions to achieve a desired outcome. This is often attributed to
                using emotions for problem-solving, or considering another’s emotions when making decisions.
            </p>
            <h3>Understanding Emotion</h3>
            <p>
                This ability relates to an individual's understanding of the complexity of emotions. It primarily
                relates to how the individual may predict emotional nuances or navigate more complex emotional
                relationships.
            </p>
            <h3>Managing Emotions</h3>
            <p>
                The capability of an individual to manage emotions both in themselves and others, and to manipulate
                emotions to achieve their goals. This ability is not necessarily seen as negative, and may be displayed
                positively through encouragement or consolation.
            </p>

            <h2>How is EQ different from IQ?</h2>
            <p>
                IQ and EQ are different measures of an individual's intelligence, and both have their similarities and
                differences.
            </p>
            <p>
                IQ is the measurement of an individual's capability to solve logical problems, understand patterns and
                predict certain outcomes through the use of long and short term memory and rationalisation. It is
                commonly assessed by the use of an IQ test.
            </p>
            <p>
                EQ, or emotional intelligence, is the measurement of an individual’s ability to understand, use and
                manage emotions in themselves and others. EQ may be measured on tests, however these testing methods are
                often criticised as being easy to manipulate.
            </p>
            <p>
                There are many different perspectives and opinions on which of the two is more important for general
                success. While IQ was often considered a defining factor of success, the focus nowadays is shifting
                towards EQ, as many consider emotional intelligence more important than the former, especially as it is
                more challenging to teach than other, more quantifiable skills.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div>
            <h2>Why is EQ Important?</h2>
            <p>
                Emotional intelligence plays an important role in the life of every individual. Since humans are social
                creatures by nature, the ability to navigate our complex world of emotions is a priceless skill to have.
                Having a good level of emotional intelligence helps to build and strengthen relationships, increase
                social awareness and operate with a high sense of empathy.
            </p>
            <p>
                In collaborative environments it is considered a highly important skill - even essential.
