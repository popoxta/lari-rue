        <div>
            <h2>What is your long-term goal or career pathway?</h2>

            <p>
                My long-term goal is to become a versatile software developer. My goals are to continuously learn about
                new languages, technologies and frameworks and apply them in both work and my personal projects.
                I would also like to have the opportunity to mentor others, as I thrive on helping people grow and learn
                new skills.
            </p>
            <p>
                In all essence, there’s a lot I love about working with software, the collaboration with people around
                me, the technologies and the creativity used to do so.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div>
            <h2>What are your strengths and limitations in learning?</h2>

            <p>
                I possess a strength in recognizing connections between prior knowledge, enabling me to quickly acquire
                new skills and learn new concepts. This is something that has allowed me to be quite ‘snappy’ in picking
                up a new skill or understanding a foreign concept!
            </p>
            <p>
                However, my main limitation stems from self-doubt. I frequently second-guess myself and attempt to
                quantify my decisions. I am actively working on overcoming this challenge by learning to trust in my
                instincts and build more confidence in my abilities.
            </p>
            <p>
                Overall, I am aware of my strengths in making connections and quickly acquiring new skills. At the same
                time, I am actively working on addressing my limitations by building self-confidence, trusting my
                instincts, and finding a more healthy balance between striving for excellence and accepting
                imperfections.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div>
            <h2>What non-technical skills would you like to see developed?</h2>

            <p>
                During my time at DevAcademy, I am wanting to actively focus on developing as many non-technical skills
                as possible to complement my technical abilities. Primarily, I am seeking to build my self-confidence as
                I believe this will allow me to approach both learning and work with greater efficiency.
            </p>
            <p>
                Another aspect I am truly looking to nurture is my aptitude for mentoring. I see it as an opportunity
                not only to help others grow, but to deepen my own knowledge and understanding.
            </p>
            <p>
                Lastly, I am determined to truly maximise the networking opportunities available through DevAcademy and
                otherwise. I believe that by forming strong connections, I can establish a positive reputation and
                meaningfully contribute to the community!
            </p>
        </div>

        <div>
            <h2>What is your commitment to managing your workload?</h2>

            <p>
                To manage my workload effectively, I am committed to using the Pomodoro technique, which involves
                tracking my time and taking breaks at regular intervals. I have found this technique to be invaluable to
                my self-lead learning, and I plan to keep using it wherever applicable.
            </p>
            <p>
                Additionally, my commitment is to be fully engaged with the course material and actively participate
                alongside the other students. I believe this commitment will allow me to produce the highest quality
                work and encourage others to do the same.
            </p>
            <p>
                During challenging times, I will openly express my feelings to my support network and seek feedback and
                guidance. I will remind myself to embrace and enjoy the journey, even when it gets difficult!
            </p>
        </div>

        <div>
            <h2>What do you expect from the facilitation team?</h2>

            <p>
                My primary expectation from the facilitation team is to consistently deliver quality feedback on
                student’s learning, progress and projects based on their experiences and industry standards. I believe
                that a steady flow of feedback is vital for achieving success in both learning and personal growth.
            </p>
            <p>
                Additionally, I have an expectation of being provided with learning opportunities (or knowledge thereof)
                of opportunities not only limited to DevAcademy. This may be anything from guidance, to advice regarding
                career and external opportunities for growth.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div>
            <h2>Do you have any block-out times which must be planned for?</h2>

            <p>
                As I am currently away from family, I have planned dates for their visits, and during these periods I
                will be working on a slightly reduced schedule. I am planning to make up for this lost time by
                dedicating additional hours during weekends and other days.
            </p>
            <p>
                The only other non-negotiable time-block in my schedule is my sleep!
            </p>
        </div>

            <h1>Bootcamp Learning Plan</h1>

        </div>

        <div>
            <h2>What is your long-term goal or career pathway?</h2>
            <p>
                My long term goal is to work within the software development industry, ideally as a Front-End Developer
                or QA Test Analyst. These are my current ambitions, however these may easily change as I learn more
                technologies and have enough time to fully settle on what role appeals to me most as a whole.
            </p>
            <p>
                Most of all I am seeking to be versatile, and I want to become an asset to my team not only in the sense
                of technical skills but soft skills as well, bringing encouragement and simply being a darn good human
                to work with.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div>
            <h2>What will be your biggest strengths and limitations in bootcamp?</h2>
            <p>
                Let’s start this off with the worst banana in the bunch - my limitations. My biggest limitation will be
                my self-doubt and anxiety, as I have a tendency to worry if I am on the right track or doing well with
                my learning.
            </p>
            <p>
                However I would like to state that this has improved massively since the beginning of foundations, and I
                have become a lot more confident in myself, what I can do, and what I’m confident I can learn as I need.
                I can be very thankful that I have a very strong kick-my-own-butt and ‘Just get out there and do it!’
                attitude, and repetition is the number one killer of anxiety!
            </p>
            <p>
                My biggest strengths in bootcamp will be, again, my attitude, as well as my ability to quickly form
                connections based on prior learning and intuition. Throughout foundations, I have also learnt that I am
                much more collaborative than I originally thought. I have been incredibly grateful to get feedback on my
                work - and I find myself wishing that there was more of it! It has also been a great experience to be
                able to help and work with the people in my cohort, and I have come to care quite deeply for our little
                home-group.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div>
            <h2>What will your biggest non-technical challenge be?</h2>
            <p>
                My biggest non-technical challenge in Bootcamp will be supporting myself emotionally, but then again, I
                also thought this would be my biggest challenge in foundations - spoiler alert: it wasn't a challenge at
                all. The biggest challenges were my prior fears, and they were overcome within the first few days of the
                course. In fact, I think my current comfort even bleeds through my writing, scroll up and see how
                different my writing style is when I’m even a little stiffly scared - like night and day, isn’t it?
            </p>
            <p>
                However I think it may be a bit different in bootcamp, as the scope of what we learn and what we do are
                all much larger in foundations, though it is truly something I will have to wait and see for myself. I
                cannot get myself too wound up in worries beforehand, as from my prior experiences everything is much,
                much easier than expected once you actually <em>start</em>.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div>
            <h2>What non-technical skills would you like to see yourself develop?</h2>
            <p>
                There are many, many non-technical skills I would like to develop until I carve myself into the perfect
                human, a living resemblance of a unicorn with the smoothest jazziest voice in existence. I’m joking,
                sort of.
            </p>
            <p>
                In all seriousness, I want to work on anything I can, based on feedback from both others and myself.
                While it’s unfortunately not possible to equitably or statistically become a good or great person, I
                want to continuously improve on myself every day and keep walking down the good path of being a better
                person than I was yesterday in some aspect, every day.
            </p>
            <p>
                I want to keep making strides in my communication skills, my emotional intelligence and leadership
                capabilities, and truly become someone that can lift the spirit of my team.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div>
            <h2>What are your expectations from the bootcamp team?</h2>
            <p>
                My expectations from the bootcamp team are a touch more stringent than during foundations! Of course, I
                think the same goes for the reverse as well. I have full faith that the bootcamp team will do their
                absolute best in order to support and teach us as much as possible, and I trust that their decisions and
                suggestions will have a meaningful impact for all students.
            </p>
            <p>
                As the nature of bootcamp will be highly collaborative, I trust that the bootcamp team will do their
                best to facilitate and encourage this. I am a bit wary about the hybrid learning model introduced for
                this cohort as it does not seem to be standardised for the curriculum, so I trust that this will be
                taken account and that we will have additional opportunities to work within the DevAcademy HQ or be
                presented the opportunity to complete our final projects as an in-person group if we so wish.
            </p>
            <p>
                I am excited to take part in this inclusive environment and I have hopes that everyone else is just as
                excited as I am to work together on exciting projects!
            </p>
        </div>

        <div>
            <h2>What are your expectations of yourself?</h2>
            <p>
                My expectations of myself are to step out of my shell even more, and as I discussed in a previous
                question - better myself every single day. I want every day to be a step forward in the right direction,
                no matter how small that step may be.
            </p>
            <p>
                I want to embrace the comfort of not knowing, and become comfortable in knowing that confidence isn’t
                about what you know now, it’s about the faith you have in yourself and what you can do, learn or
                accomplish.
            </p>
            <p>
                I also want to take as many opportunities as I possibly can, and not let anything slip me by. I want to
                take any opportunity I can to gain feedback, knowledge, experience, skills - anything. Attending
                DevAcademy is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity, and I want to make the most of my time here to progress
                myself and those around me.
