        <div class="blog-section">
            <h2 class="blog-subheader">What is your long-term goal or career pathway?</h2>

            <p>
                My long-term goal is to become a versatile software developer. My goals are to continuously learn about
                new languages, technologies and frameworks and apply them in both work and my personal projects.
                I would also like to have the opportunity to mentor others, as I thrive on helping people grow and learn
                new skills.
            </p>
            <p>
                In all essence, there’s a lot I love about working with software, the collaboration with people around
                me, the technologies and the creativity used to do so.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="blog-section">
            <h2 class="blog-subheader">What are your strengths and limitations in learning?</h2>

            <p>
                I possess a strength in recognizing connections between prior knowledge, enabling me to quickly acquire
                new skills and learn new concepts. This is something that has allowed me to be quite ‘snappy’ in picking
                up a new skill or understanding a foreign concept!
            </p>
            <p>
                However, my main limitation stems from self-doubt. I frequently second-guess myself and attempt to
                quantify my decisions. I am actively working on overcoming this challenge by learning to trust in my
                instincts and build more confidence in my abilities.
            </p>
            <p>
                Overall, I am aware of my strengths in making connections and quickly acquiring new skills. At the same
                time, I am actively working on addressing my limitations by building self-confidence, trusting my
                instincts, and finding a more healthy balance between striving for excellence and accepting
                imperfections.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="blog-section">
            <h2 class="blog-subheader">What non-technical skills would you like to see developed?</h2>

            <p>
                During my time at DevAcademy, I am wanting to actively focus on developing as many non-technical skills
                as possible to complement my technical abilities. Primarily, I am seeking to build my self-confidence as
                I believe this will allow me to approach both learning and work with greater efficiency.
            </p>
            <p>
                Another aspect I am truly looking to nurture is my aptitude for mentoring. I see it as an opportunity
                not only to help others grow, but to deepen my own knowledge and understanding.
            </p>
            <p>
                Lastly, I am determined to truly maximise the networking opportunities available through DevAcademy and
                otherwise. I believe that by forming strong connections, I can establish a positive reputation and
                meaningfully contribute to the community!
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="blog-section">
            <h2 class="blog-subheader">What is your commitment to managing your workload?</h2>

            <p>
                To manage my workload effectively, I am committed to using the Pomodoro technique, which involves
                tracking my time and taking breaks at regular intervals. I have found this technique to be invaluable to
                my self-lead learning, and I plan to keep using it wherever applicable.
            </p>
            <p>
                Additionally, my commitment is to be fully engaged with the course material and actively participate
                alongside the other students. I believe this commitment will allow me to produce the highest quality
                work and encourage others to do the same.
            </p>
            <p>
                During challenging times, I will openly express my feelings to my support network and seek feedback and
                guidance. I will remind myself to embrace and enjoy the journey, even when it gets difficult!
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="blog-section">
            <h2 class="blog-subheader">What do you expect from the facilitation team?</h2>

            <p>
                My primary expectation from the facilitation team is to consistently deliver quality feedback on
                student’s learning, progress and projects based on their experiences and industry standards. I believe
                that a steady flow of feedback is vital for achieving success in both learning and personal growth.
            </p>
            <p>
                Additionally, I have an expectation of being provided with learning opportunities (or knowledge thereof)
                of opportunities not only limited to DevAcademy. This may be anything from guidance, to advice regarding
                career and external opportunities for growth.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="blog-section">
            <h2 class="blog-subheader">Do you have any block-out times which must be planned for?</h2>

            <p>
                As I am currently away from family, I have planned dates for their visits, and during these periods I
                will be working on a slightly reduced schedule. I am planning to make up for this lost time by
                dedicating additional hours during weekends and other days.
            </p>
            <p>
                The only other non-negotiable time-block in my schedule is my sleep!
