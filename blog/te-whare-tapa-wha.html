        <div class="wide center extra-bottom">
            <p>
                The Te Whare Tapa Whā model is a framework of health and well-being based on Māori cultural values and
                beliefs, established by Sir Mason Durie, a prominent Māori psychiatrist and academic.
            </p>
            <p>
                The term Te Whare Tapa Whā translates to ‘the four-sided house’ in English, using this metaphor to
                establish four dimensions of wellbeing, namely physical, mental, social and spiritual and establishing
                its foundation as an additional dimension - land.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div>
            <h2>Taha Tinana</h2>
            <p>
                Taha Tinana focuses on physical health and wellbeing, including exercise, nutrition, rest and taking
                care of one’s health.
            </p>
            <p>
                My Taha Tinana is strengthened by partaking in regular exercise - my favourite being long walks.
                Additionally, I can ensure that I keep this pillar strengthened by nourishing my body with quality food
                and sticking to my sleeping schedule.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div>
            <h2>Taha Hinengaro</h2>
            <p>
                Taha Hinengaro refers to the wellbeing of the mind and emotional state of an individual.
            </p>
            <p>
                My Taha Hinengaro is strengthened by treating myself with kindness and respect, as well as ensuring that
                my stress levels are kept within a manageable range. I can continue to improve my Taha Hinengaro by
                making sure that I take time out for myself to relax and praise myself on my efforts.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div>
            <h2>Taha Wairua</h2>
            <p>
                Taha Tina focuses on spirituality and life-force, establishing who you are and your path ahead.
            </p>
            <p>
                My Taha Wairua is strengthened by my belief in purpose and creating meaningful change through my
                existence. I can strengthen this pillar during my journey by building my connection to the world around
                me, as well as consistently gaining a better understanding of myself and my identity.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div>
            <h2>Taha Whānau</h2>
            <p>
                Taha Whānau is the focus on belonging, family and connections to the people and community around you.
            </p>
            <p>
                My Taha Whānau is strengthened by making quality time to spend with my family and my partner to support
                both myself and them. Additionally, I am wanting to do more work within the community by volunteering
                and
                helping others live richer lives.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div>
            <h2>Whenua</h2>
            <p>
                Whenua is the land and the foundation for all other dimensions, and refers to the place of belonging and
                identity.
            </p>
            <p>
                My connection to the land is strengthened by the bonds, experiences and beauty I have witnessed within
                this country and this planet. I can continue to strengthen my connection to Whenua by allowing myself to
                enjoy the everyday wonders around me, and allowing nature to help strengthen my overall wellbeing.

            <h2>My Commitment</h2>
            <p>
                My commitment to myself during this journey is to continually build and improve on these four walls, and
                deepen my understanding of not only technologies, but of myself, others, and the world around me as
                well.
                I believe that this will lead to a brighter path for myself and the community and land around me - small
                actions can have big influences.
