            <h1>Neuroplasticity</h1>
            <hr>

        <div>
            <h2>What is neuroplasticity?</h2>

            <p>
                Neuroplasticity refers to the brain’s ability to adapt and change by creating new connections between
                neurons, a change which may happen at a structural or functional level. It allows for the brain to
                reorganise and adapt to changes in experience and environmental factors.
            </p>
            <p>
                Structural Plasticity are the changes that take place as a result of experience or learning, whether
                they are real or imagined. Functional Plasticity, on the other hand, refers to the brain’s ability to
                compensate for damage by shifting certain brain functions from a damaged section of the brain to an
                undamaged one.
            </p>
            <p>
                Neuroplasticity may be encouraged in individuals by techniques such as deliberate practice, the learning
                of new concepts, imagination, reflection and other such activities that both engage and challenge the
                brain, forming stronger connections between neurons.
                When learning or reflection is contextualised and practised time and time again, this knowledge becomes
                ingrained, as the brain tends to retain information that is perceived as important or frequently used.
            </p>
            <p>
                As is often said, - “Neurons that wire together, fire together”.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div>
            <h2>What are the benefits of understanding the principles of neuroplasticity?</h2>
            <p>
                Having an understanding of neuroplasticity has shown to greatly benefit individuals in both their
                learning mindset and subsequently, their behaviour.
            </p>
            <p>
                Learners become more conscious and intentional in their experiences and learning, allowing them to truly
                take advantage of the brain’s strength to create new connections.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div>
            <h2>How might you engage with the principles of neuroplasticity for your own benefit?</h2>
            <p>
                The most effective way to increase neuroplasticity is through practice or learning new skills, and that
                is exactly what my plans are for the foreseeable (and unforeseeable) future!
            </p>
            <p>
                Learning and building on your own neuroplasticity is a life-long endeavour, and I am to build upon my
                own brain’s neuroplasticity with practice, and by constantly challenging myself both in skills and
                mindset.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div>
            <h2>What are ways to increase neuroplasticity?</h2>
            <p>
                As the brain is completely malleable - Neurons that fire together, wire together - the best way to
                increase neuroplasticity is to learn new skills or practise existing ones, primarily if in the context
                of deliberate practice - practising a skill with the pure goal of improving by stepping out of the
                relative comfort zone.
            </p>

        <div>
            <h2>What are some useful resources?</h2>
            <p>
                Aside from the provided resources, which were very engaging and useful, some additional resources I have
                found useful are the following.
