            <hr>
        </div>

        <div>
            <h2>What are three new things you learnt about yourself in Core?</h2>
            <p>
                The three most important things which I discovered about myself during Core relate to my place amongst
                my peers and my own mental image of myself.
            </p>

            <h3>Numero uno</h3>
            <p>
                I’ve come to realise that while I often thought I was much behind and lesser than many others, I’m on
                much more equal footing in a lot of aspects than I thought. Sometimes it’s very difficult to get over
                your own biases of yourself, and I think that this is something that has been a stunning focus for me -
                coming to terms with my identity and who I really am amongst others.
            </p>

            <h3>Numero dos</h3>
            <p>
                Secondly, I have learnt how important it is to reflect on your daily learning. Since starting DevAcademy
                I have taken to journaling every single day.
            </p>
            <p>
                At the beginning of my day, roughly 6.15am after I’ve hastily poured some oat milk onto my rice
                krispies, I host my own mini one-man standup, and discuss my tasks, goals and challenges for the day.
                Then at the end of my day before bed, I revisit this and write down what I accomplished and what I
                learned during the day.
            </p>
            <p>
                Journaling has helped me understand my learning process much better, and writing about my learning makes
                this much more ingrained as well. I’ve always been a bit of a document-er, my personal notes on
                programming span approximately 350+ pages, with not a lick of copy-paste.
            </p>
            <p>
                Should’ve been a journalist!
            </p>

            <h3>Numero tres</h3>
            <p>
                In some ways, the best and worst thing is that I learnt I’m much more of a collaborative person than I
                originally thought. In all honesty, it has made it quite hard during DevAcademy, as the experience so
                far has felt incredibly isolating. Many people attending have been very anxious about their abilities,
                or if they are behind or less knowledgeable about topics, making them quite reluctant to participate.
                While I have tried to encourage others to participate more socially or collaboratively, it has
                ultimately been quite fruitless.
            </p>
            <p>
                In the end, that’s okay, I’ve done what I can and I will continue to encourage others to participate
                socially and open up when they have struggles or questions. With enough time, kindness and respect we
                can all blossom and encourage others to do the same.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div>
            <h2>What are the roles of values, empathy and self awareness in learning and programming?</h2>
            <p>
                In my opinion the values of empathy, self-awareness and respect are values which should have a strong
                focus in any profession or role that has a focus on people. Ideally, all of them.
            </p>
            <p>
                The ability to navigate your own emotions and those of others is one that is often underrepresented and
                underappreciated, however this is rapidly changing in the modern world. I think that if we cannot hold
                values and share these values with others in an uplifting manner, we may as well not work
                collaboratively at all.
            </p>
            <p>
                And where would we be without collaboration? We likely wouldn't have even made it to the stone age.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div>
            <h2>What has surprised you most about Core?</h2>
            <p>
                The biggest surprise was funnily enough how big the focus was on Core. Each sprint has been quite
                cleanly split into Tech and Core, and I think it is a good primer, especially in a course like
                DevAcademy where there is a lot to learn. It will be certainly overwhelming at times, but the teachings
                of Core will certainly help us navigate through those difficult times.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div>
            <h2>What were the most challenging aspects of Core?</h2>
            <p>
                The most challenging aspect of core is that we have to face ourselves, who we are, our ego and our
                beliefs and misconceptions about ourselves. It is a lifelong process, but core puts a bit of an
                accelerator on it, that’s one certainty I won’t be shaken on.
            </p>
            <p>
                Looking in the mirror, breaking down your strengths, perceptions, values and staring down your ego
                aren’t easy things to do, but they are absolutely necessary. If you cannot figure out who you are, how
                can you possibly think of improving on it?
            </p>
        </div>

        <div>
            <h2>Why do you think we, as a programming school, focus so much time on Core?</h2>
            <p>
                I think that while the tech skills teach us what we need to know to get started on the job market as a
                web developer, the core skills are part of what sets us up for success in life and the future.
            </p>
            <p>
                As much as we sometimes like to fight it, humans are pack animals, meaning that we’re inherently social.
                This is also a huge benefit for us, as two brains is better than one, and the more heads you add the
                better and faster our progress as a species becomes. Working collaboratively is key to developing
                ourselves, our future, or just the product we want to sell, and we’ve got to know how to be a decent
                human to collaborate well.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div>
            <h2>Does the time spent studying Core feel like a waste? Should you have used that time to practise
                programming instead? Justify.</h2>
            <p>
                Of course it can feel like quite the waste of time when thinking about what we need to get through the
                program successfully *now*. But that’s the thing, it seems like a waste when looking at it now, yet when
                looking at the bigger picture the value of learning core concepts is much more important, as it serves
                as a good basis for further learning and teamwork.
            </p>
            <p>
                It’s a bit of a struggle for all of us, because we think of what we need to work through now, and
                sometimes the grander picture becomes abstract to the point of being vague.
            </p>
            <p>
                I think it is something that could likely do with a little less focus in foundations, however the level
                of focus that is placed onto core is not something that could or should be done away with easily or
                carelessly. It’s a fine balance to strike, and it varies person to person.
